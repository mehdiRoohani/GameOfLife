INTRODUCTION
------------

The short introduction starts with a spark.So yea there
is no particular goal of the game but you could have
limitless, we shall put some more insight on this in the
imminent text. The game includes a grid, provided with
some initial state that some grids toggled on with all
other being off, it enters into a loop, where you could
also toggle on and off the grid during the play.

The game revolves around the 4 rules,

    - Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population.
    - Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
    - Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.
    - Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

With this all, you could design a variety of patterns, and
will have limitless possibilities to take the game forward. Interesting, eh?

As the name suggests, the game stimulates the idea of life
and expands the application computer sciences to the study
of human life very brilliantly yet amazing. The science of
grid is similar to that of the mechanism of cells in the human body.


HOW TO PLAY
-----------

You are provided with some built in patterns which you could
choose from the menu appearing on left side of your screen.

After selecting any of the one you could see the every next
iteration by pressing the Next button appearing down to it.

You are also provided with a Start button which allows you to
see the iterations occuring at certain interval of time.

Expectedly there is a Stop button which will pause the constantly
occuring iterations.

In between the menu, you will find "Click for high/low speed" written
somewhere, it is a button to change the speed for constantly occuring
iterations. The low speed runs a at 0.3 seconds interval while the high
speed makes it 0.1 seconds interval.

While paused or in loop, you could interfere any time in the grid,
ans switch the toggled state of the grid.

This will also allow you to design your own patterns.
